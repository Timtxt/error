      <a href="https://app.netlify.com/sites/callygraphic/" target="_blank">Calligraphic Lines</a> – Slow movements create thin strokes, while fast gestures generate bold lines. A digital drawing tool that transforms motion into expressive form.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://wurmy.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Calligraphic Snake</a> – Next generation: this version introduces distinct point animations. Movement becomes visual rhythm—each gesture creates bold, animated lines shaped by speed and direction.

  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    </em>e.r.r.o.r. emerged as part of Tim Petter’s bachelor’s project at HAW Hamburg. The work explores interactive and generative design, using code as a tool for artistic exploration. Through visual systems and user-driven interactions, it pushes the boundaries of traditional graphic design. Scalability, transformation, and real-time responsiveness are central principles, allowing the work to continuously evolve through user input.

The website serves as a collection point for these works, making the project accessible and open for free use. errorspace invites users to participate and shape the experience. It offers continuous creative evolution through SVG export options, enabling program-independent further development.
